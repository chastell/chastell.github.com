title: Make ’em dry

Dawno (no… nie licząc [Pratchetta](/the-maze-was-so-small 'wycinek o „Zbrojnych”'), oczywiście) nie przeczytałem książki w takim tempie – [6 dni](/dont-panic 'wycinek o „Life, the Universe and Everything”')! Wiem, wiem, kiedyś książka dziennie to był dopiero punkt wyjścia, ale… cóż, ostatnio jakoś mi to nie wychodzi. Niemniej – czwarty tom przygód Arthura Denta bardzo mi się podobał, IMHO lepszy od trzeciego. Podobnie jak u Pratchetta, urzekł mnie opis dań barowych:

> There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special kind of pallor to the pork pies.
>
> Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches.
>
> There is a feeling which persists in England that making a sandwich interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat is something sinful that only foreingers do.
>
> ‘Make ’em dry,’ is the instruction buried somewhere in the collective national consciousness, ‘make ’em rubbery. If you have to keep the bugges fresh, do it by washing ’em one a week.’
>
> It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that the British seel to atone for whatever their national sins have been. They’re not altogether clear what those sins are, and don’t want to know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to know about. But whatever sins there are are amply atoned for by the sandwiches they make themselves eat.
>
> If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the sausages which sit next to them. Joyless tubes, full of gristle, floating in a sea of something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic pin in the shape of a chef’s hat: a memorial, one feels, for some chef who hated the world, and died, forgotten and alone among his cats on a back stair in Stepney.
>
> The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and wish to atone for something specific.
