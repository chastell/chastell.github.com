This should’ve probably landed in the sightings area, but then the three of you could miss it, and you really shouldn’t, for [Maciej’s notes on the Tatra Mountains](http://www.idlewords.com/2004/04/bukowina_tatrza_ska.htm '‘górale’ rhymes with ‘Podhale’, y’see') are well worth the read.

If you ever come to Poland for holidays, don’t even _try_ to hesitate whether to visit Podhale or not. There might be [people](http://thoughtscriber.net/ 'I’m doing my best to straighten this up') suggesting that our seaside is better, and they may even have some valid points with [Gdańsk](http://en.gdansk.gda.pl/ 'the city’s official site') and its pre-WW2 [specifics](http://sabaoth.infoserve.pl/danzig-online/coins/coinse.html 'I’m a sucker for these things') as a Free City, but, frankly, all this is still no match for our mountains, with all the snow in the winter, hiking in the summer and the food all year long. Then there are the sights.

(If you’re still not convinced enough to read all of Maciej’s entry, or see the house I once stayed in – the one behind the lantern in the middle of the fourth photo – do at least check the recipe for Highlander[^1] Tea and the seven-step tutorial on How to Smuggle Grain Alcohol Into the United States, as I can totally foresee both coming in handy at some point in everybody’s life.)
