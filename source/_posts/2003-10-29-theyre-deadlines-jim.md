Because, you see, there’s this thing with our thesis. It’s not that we’re not writing it, or at least not working on it, or – at _least_ – not thinking about it a lot; it’s that there doesn’t seem to be a definitive deadline, only a vague idea of ‘we’ve got to defend it someday in February’, and if there’s one thing the seventeen years of education taught me, it’s that Deadlines Are Everything™. The other problem is that no earlier than two months ago it was still ‘…someday in September’, and then the 15<sup>th</sup> – which turned out to be _the_ deadline back then – flew by, and, as you can see, it all somehow didn’t work out as expected. We’re still trying to figure out what exactly went wrong, concurrently coming up with more and more excuses on why it was really essential for us to retain the student status, as opposed to be mere graduates with uncertain future and all that. (The outcome as of today is that we feel quite strong in the excuses department. C’mon, it’s always something.)

Of course everything can change the day we finally go to the deanery, ask the one question we’ve been afraid to ask for two months now, and hear the dreaded ‘but gentlemen, don’t you know? the deadline for the springtime defenses is December 15<sup>th</sup>!’. There’s a chance you’ll notice this by my grave silence around these parts.
