After today’s introduction of this amazing technology on <cite>[wycinki](/wycinki 'my Polish weblog')</cite>, <cite>the eelful hovercraft</cite> quickly follows suit with your captain giving you full insight into the log from the ship’s one and only[^1] crow’s nest. Do enjoy.

(Any passengers suggesting that they have yet to see a crow’s-nest-equipped hovercraft are to be reminded that (1) this ain’t no typical vessel and (2) they should really be grateful that they’re still able to make such snappy remarks at all – what with all these eels and other weird stuff around here – and perhaps concentrate more on how does exactly their captain manage to both steer the ship and sit in the crow’s nest at the same time.)

\[All passengers are requested to note that The Great 2010 Refurbishment of the <cite>old eelful</cite> replaced the crow’s nest with some [proper sonar equipment](/pings 'the machine that goes ping'). This was your captain speaking; carry on.\]

[^1]: only because two crow’s nests on one ship would look stupid, really
