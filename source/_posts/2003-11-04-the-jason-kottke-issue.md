title: The Jason Kottke issue
---

If you’ve ever wondered how low can I go – well, I guess this might be it. I envy [Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/ '‘Speed 3: If he stops writing, the bus will blow up’… seems a fair trade to me').

Ever since my girlfriend discovered kottke.org there simply haven’t been a single day without him popping up here or there in our conversations. All these ‘wow, take a look at <cite>[top 10 secrets of a successful web site](http://0sil8.com/episodes/97/12/05/ '0sil8.com? c’mon, what’s this supposed to mean?')</cite>!’, ‘have you seen [this](http://mena.typepad.com/photos/segway/imgp0061.html 'wear-a-nifty-T-shirt-ride-a-Segway-and-they’re-all-yours')?’, ‘have you seen [that](http://kottke.org/02/03/how-i-feel-about-the-web '‘How I feel about the Web’ – as if anyone cared!')?’ (it’s a classic, old _Polish_ photo, girl – have some pride, for gods’ sake!); and then, not a week ago, she has linked one of his age-old entries on her weblog. Not to mention that you definitely wouldn’t like me to describe what was going on around here when Jason was [covering live](http://kottke.org/03/11/maciej-p-diddy-marathon 'from his couch, no less') the New York City Marathon. (The question is, of course, would [Maciej](http://www.idlewords.com/ 'our man across the Big Pond') still have lost if JK had passed on the whole thing. We will never know.)

I’m not sure when exactly did I realize what my feelings truly are, but I suspect something must’ve snapped when we were chatting on IM, and she suddenly quoted the <cite>Boy from New York</cite> Manhattan Transfer song (you know, the one that goes ‘He’s kind of tall / He’s really fine / Some day I hope to make him mine, all mine / And he’s neat / And oh so sweet / And just the way he looked at me / He swept me off my feet’). Promptly adding that the quote is _not_ about Kottke. Before I had the slightest chance to even start making the connection.

There’s a Peugeot 307 ad running in Polish cinemas lately, ‘terrible thing, envy’. You have no idea.
