Totally surprised by the fact that [the end of the year](/hovercraft/the-end-of-the-year.png 'Tuesday’s Non Sequitur') has come so early I’m serving you yet another placeholder post, this time with the two discoveries of the passing 2004: <cite>[Sinfest](http://sinfest.net/ 'dig through the archives, please do')</cite> in the Sights category and <cite>[A Night at the Hip-Hopera](http://waxy.org/archive/2004/09/23/kleptone.shtml 'at Waxy.org')</cite> in Sounds (at least check out <cite>Break</cite> and <cite>Listen</cite>, and perhaps <cite>Ride</cite>, and <cite>Sniff</cite>, and <cite>Plan</cite>…).

The Foxy One tells me to leave this Internet café immediately and get in proper New Year’s Eve mood, so I’d better listen. Have a happy 2005.
