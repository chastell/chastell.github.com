title: Best birthday ever
---

A lot of things have been happening lately, with the brightest spot being your captain (how else) turning twenty-five last Sunday; I’ve been spending some time at the Foxy One’s, on a short holiday after the final marathon of turning in [the thesis](/theyre-deadlines-jim 'they were deadlines, Jim') not a day later than a week and a year past the initial deadline (go us!).

Having had a month of coding PHP, drawing graphs and writing LaTeX like a PHP-coding-graph-drawing-LaTeX-writing powerhouse for fourteen hours a day I _really_ couldn’t stand the sight of my laptop, so I spent the better part of the birthday lying with it on the couch and re-learning[^1] Python; after reintroducing myself to <cite>[Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/ 'the classic starting point')</cite>, skimming through <cite>[Python Grimoire](http://the.taoofmac.com/space/dev/Python/Grimoire 'how to perform common programming tasks')</cite> and reading most of <cite>[Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org/ 'Mark Pilgrim at his best')</cite> a small script sprang into life, downloaded all of the <cite>[Wulffmorgenthaler](http://wulffmorgenthaler.com/ 'a comic strip not for the faint of heart')</cite> archives and made all of the <cite>hovercraft</cite> crew declare Python the best programming language evah. And just when I thought life couldn’t possibly get any better, all of a sudden [this](/hovercraft/dish-of-the-years.jpg 'dish of the years') appeared before my very eyes – stating, in pasta, that ‘WOJTEK IS 25 YEARS OLD’.

To say I was stunned would be a great understatement, but soon it turned out I didn’t know _anything_ about being stunned just yet.

A pair of classy boxer shorts.

A black-and-blue-striped blouse.

A 1910s map of Łódź, the Foxy One’s home city.

A variety of old Łódź postcards.

Two (two!) boxes of chocolates.

A selection of small bath balls filled with liquid soap, which certainly have their own name in English, but I can’t, for the life of me, figure it out at the moment.

But\\
above all\\
seated modestly next to the other presents\\
was\\
a duck.

A [rubber ducky](/they-never-lose-their-smiles 'They never lose their smiles').

Yellow. With a red beak.

No, really – [see for yourselves](/hovercraft/the-trio.jpg 'the laptop shows Jeffrey Veen’s ‘Making a Better Open Source CMS’') (the ducky is the one without the boxer shorts on the head).

> That’s made for you and I?\\

> Who is floating coast to coast\\

> Forever float on bubbly waters\\
> High! High! High! High!

> Come along and sing a song\\

I think I’ll call her Lady Duck.
