  tar and feather

     <jargon> (A sick contrivance from the {Unix} {tar}
     command and the Ku Klux Klan torture method) To
     create a transportable archive from a group of
     files by first sticking them together with {tar}
     (the Tape ARchiver) and then {compress}ing the
     result.  The latter action is dubbed "feathering"
     (purely for contrived effect) by analogy to what
     you do with an aeroplane propeller to decrease
     wind resistance, or with an oar to reduce water
     resistance; smaller files, after all, slip
     through comm links more easily.

From Jargon File (4.4.4, 14 Aug 2003) [jargon]:

  tar and feather
   vi.

     [from Unix tar(1)] To create a transportable
     archive from a group of files by first sticking
     them together with tar(1) (the Tape ARchiver)
     and then compressing the result (see {compress}).
     The latter action is dubbed feathering partly for
     euphony and (if only for contrived effect) by
     analogy to what you do with an airplane propeller
     to decrease wind resistance, or with an oar to
     reduce water resistance; smaller files, after all,
     slip through comm links more easily. Compare the
     more common {tarball}. Earlier, the phrase referred
     to a punishment in which the victims had tar being
     poured upon them and then, whilst the tar was still
     sticky, having a pillow full of feathers - or other
     material -- thrown at them. See
