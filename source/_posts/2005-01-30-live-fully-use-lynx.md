And here I was, sitting and thinking it’s going to be yet another placeholder post, when the beloved [linux-elitists mailing list](http://zgp.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-elitists/ 'An experiment in MUA-based list moderation') comes to rescue with the following:

> A Londonder made a tsnuami-relief donation using lynx – a text-based browser used by the blind, Unix-users and others – on Sun’s Solaris operating system. The site-operator decided that this ‘unusual’ event in the system log indicated a hack-attempt, and the police broke down the donor’s door and arrested him.

What’s even more interesting, though, is [the BBC’s version](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4195339.stm 'Tsunami fund ‘hacking’ is probed') of the story. ‘I’ve noticed that the press tends to be quite accurate, except when they’re writing on a subject I know something about.’ Indeed.

Meantime, in other parts of the world, your captain made himself [a photolog](1-125 '1/125') and somebody else made some fantastic [Hiëronymus Bosch action figures](http://3d-mouseion.com/engels/bosch_eng.htm 'via Boing Boing, as well'). Do enjoy.
