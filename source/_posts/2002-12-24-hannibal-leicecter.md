Jeszcze niedawno zastanawiałem się, czy proszenie Mikołaja o [książkę o ginących gatunkach](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345371984/ 'Last Chance to See') tylko dlatego, że jej autorem jest Douglas Adams, to nie przesada. Ale pomyślałem sobie – co, _ja_ nie zaryzykuję? I okazało się, że znów był to strzał w dziesiątkę.

> Antananarivo is pronounced _Tananarive_, and for much of this century has been spelt that way as well. When the French took over the Madagascar at the end of the last century (‘colonised’ is probably too kind a word for moving in on a country that was doing perfectly well for itself but which the French simply took a fancy to), they were impatient with the curious Malagasy habit of not bothering to pronounce the first and last syllabes of place names. They decided, in their rational Gallic way, that if that was how the names were pronounced then they could damn well be spelt that way too. It would be rather as if someone had taken over England and told us that from now on we would be spelling Leicester ‘Lester’ and liking it. We might be forced to spell it that way, but we wouldn’t like it, and neither did the Malagasy. As soon as they managed to divest themselves of French rule, in 1960, they promptly reinstated all the old spellings and just kept the cooking and the bureaucracy.
