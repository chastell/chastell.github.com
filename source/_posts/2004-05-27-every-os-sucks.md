title: Every OS sucks, this one just sucks less
---

One of the things I like most in the Open Source community is the the way people don’t really force themselves into any kind of proper language, and [express themselves quite freely](http://lists.debian.org/debian-x/2004/05/msg00693.html 'Branden Robinson’s announcement on debian-x') instead. The other is the general frankness (see, for example, [my email](http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2004/05/msg00285.html 'GNOME 2.6 is slowly trickling down to Debian/unstable') to debian-gtk-gnome and [the sincere response](http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2004/05/msg00286.html 'these are the joys of unstable') I got).

There’s a [song](http://deadtroll.com/video/ossuckscable.html 'free rendition of ‘Every OS Sucks’') by Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie that sums it all up pretty nicely, with the relevant verses being:

> Now there’s Lih-nux or Lie-nux –\\

(The truth, of course, is that Linux is a bit like Churchill’s democracy – the worst operating system except all the other I’ve tried from time to time. And I do love it.)
