So, yes, there’s no denying this anymore – given a 1½ meter[^1] long ethernet cable I can’t be trusted not to at least [consider](http://thoughtscriber.net/000010.html 'the revolution will be live') the opportunities at hand. This time I chickened out and thus am writing this in my beloved Vim, peacefully running in a fifth tab of a GNOME Terminal, but you never know what tomorrow will bring.

As for that fifth-tab thing: now as I think of it, I do have [NADD](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html 'Nerd Attention Deficiency Disorder'), if not some kind of a super-NADD. Rands’s example consists of mere seven different applications plus three tabs in Safari; here it’s six terminals, seven other apps, an eight-tabbed Firebird, and anybody moving my icons by a milimeter[^2] risks being strangled with the aforementioned cable.
