title: They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow

There are those rare times when everything seems to be happening at once, with you in the middle of the most bizarre, sweet and sour events you wouldn’t imagine possible – maybe in stories, yes, but definitely not in your everyday life. Those times when you balance between deep sadness and exploding joy, when there’s so much you would change in the past if only given the chance, yet at the same time thinking that perhaps the whole situation will be worth it in the end. Times when  you’d gladly talk about all this with somebody, but even though you’re the last person to be superstitious you just can’t help but believe that mere sharing of what’s going on could ruin everything, if for no other reason than to prove this or that twisted implementation of Murphy’s Law. And then there are those people who simply wouldn’t understand, or who would try to tell you how slight are your chances, even though they don’t know any details and never had anything like that happen to them (or, worse, have it happened and didn’t work out).

I’ve been through this half a year ago, and a certain person (whom I don’t know well yet, but like very much already) seems to be going through something similar as you read these words. All I can say is that these so-called miracles _do_ happen from time to time, and I believe they’re worth a try more often than not.

And so I’m sitting here, with <cite>Kill Bill</cite> soundtrack, Moloko’s <cite>Things to Make and Do</cite> and Dylan’s <cite>Greatest Hits</cite> (how’s that for variety) looping over and over again in my dear xmms, catching up on email and keeping my fingers crossed. This weblog wasn’t supposed to start this way, but, man, am I glad it could.
