title: An old meme is rising
---

There is that meme of blogging live from a WiFi-equipped conference with more or less useful thoughts instead of paying attention to what the conference is about. Hello, my name is Piotr Szotkowski and Iâ€™m attending [Localisation Sprint](http://tacticaltech.org/localisationsprint 'previously at localisationdev.org *and* localizationdev.org') at the moment.

More or less useful, as I said.

(In all seriousness, though, the Sprint is great fun and I met more fantastic people here already than I did during the past half year, and learned more about localisation than I ever wanted to. Go [TTC](http://tacticaltech.org/ 'Tactical Technology Collective')!)
