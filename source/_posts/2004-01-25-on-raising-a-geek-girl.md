title: On raising a geek-girl
---

The Foxy One got herself a [new weblog](http://thoughtscriber.net/ 'Miss Thoughtscriber dot Net') and decided to go English this time (one cannot help but wonder what could possibly push her in that direction), which of course is great news on its own, but the real catch is that she managed to do it almost all by herself. She learned the basics of XHTML, CSS and Movable Type in just under (otherwise busy) two weeks, which made me both very proud and a little anxious – you know, that disturbing feeling that comes just a moment after you’ve explained the deepest secrets of your craft to a complete[^1] greenhorn, with the greenhorn nodding all the time and saying it’s clear and easy and please go on; the feeling when you simply cannot decide whether it is you who is the greatest teacher ever walking the surface of this planet, or maybe it’s the other way around and it’s your job, much easier than you thought just a minute before, and overally, let’s face it, a rather simple one. That feeling.

But other than the occasional doubt (somebody will say that the doubt certainly builds character[^2] or something to that point, and I’d gladly agree, as it is always good to assume that each and every fucking little thing happening in one’s life has some good points after all, even the smallest person can change the course of the future and all that), so, as I was saying, other than this feeling thing I must admit that the learing process was a blast, that we[^3] had a great time, and that we’re going to have more of the same in the near future, hopefully. (Hmmm, now as I think of it, there arises the problem that she is much more artistically able than I will ever be, so if I eventually did pass all my knowledge to her I could diminish, and go into the West, and remain your captain, while she would take care of the web-bussinesses and raising the children and what not. How’s that for a reassuring thought; we will begin the second set of the webmastry classes tomorrow.)

Well, all I wanted to say here is that’s an amazing thing to be able to teach the geek stuff to another person on her own request, to show how to do all of the tech things the Right Way and see her truly enjoy it. Amazing. Not unlike in [this here PvP strip](http://www.pvponline.com/2004/01/15/thu-jan-15/ 's/Mac/Linux, of course'), really.
