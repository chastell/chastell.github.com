What’s more, eight pages earlier there’s this taxonomical picture with varieties of the Swamp Dragon, including 11, the Golden Deceiver, and 3, the Nothingfjord Blue (wonderful scales, but a tendency to homesickness). Makes one wonder whether ‘the eelful hovercraft’ wasn’t too primitive a reference and that maybe I should have gone with something a bit subtler, more to the point of ‘scratched record industries’ or ‘things that cannot wait till lunchtime’. I wish to plead incompetence.
