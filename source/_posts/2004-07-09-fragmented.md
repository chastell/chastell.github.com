title: I wonder whether Catholics are fragmented this much as well

I’m sure the two of you across the Big Pond know most of Emo Philips’s texts by heart (and if not most, the below is a classic anyway), but this one made my day more than once this week, so I’m going to put it here for future use if nothing else:

> I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off. So I ran over and said, ‘Stop! Don’t do it!’
>
> ‘Why shouldn’t I?’ he said.
>
> I said, ‘Well, there’s so much to live for!’
>
> He said, ‘Like what?’
>
> I said, ‘Well… are you religious or atheist?’
>
> He said, ‘Religious.’
>
> I said, ‘Me too! Are you Christian or Buddhist?’
>
> He said, ‘Christian.’
>
> I said, ‘Me too! Are you Catholic or Protestant?’
>
> He said, ‘Protestant.’
>
> I said, ‘Me too! Are you Episcopalian or Baptist?’
>
> He said, ‘Baptist!’
>
> I said, ‘Wow! Me too! Are you Baptist Church of God or Baptist Church of the Lord?’
>
> He said, ‘Baptist Church of God!’
>
> I said, ‘Me too! Are you Original Baptist Church of God, or are you Reformed Baptist Church of God?’
>
> He said, ‘Reformed Baptist Church of God!’
>
> I said, ‘Me too! Are you Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1879, or Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915?’
>
> He said, ‘Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915!’
>
> I said, ‘Die, heretic scum!’ and pushed him off.
>
> Emo Phillips

(I found it via [the geek version](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/07/06/nfc 'Unicode Normalization Form C') Mark did last Tuesday.)
