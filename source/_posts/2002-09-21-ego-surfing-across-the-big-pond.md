Z wczorajszych rozmów z [Jasonem](http://deeplyshallow.com/ 'deeplyshallow'):

> — The translation of my today’s entry will arrive as soon as I type it. Sorry for my English, I haven’t had English classes for four and a half years, and those were my highschool’s ones, not of a high level. You’ll have to manage, somehow, I’m affraid.
>
> — Take your time, and I’ll manage just fine. Your English is remarkably good. I actually figured English was your first language, and Polish was maybe your second.
>
> — So my Polish is _that_ bad? Now I’m shocked.
>
> — Yes, it’s horrible. I can’t understand a word of it.
