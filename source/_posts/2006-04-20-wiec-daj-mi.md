W pracy rozpoczęliśmy dziś z Pablem sezon letni, przenosząc się radośnie z laptopami z piwnicy do ogródka (if I was to use Bugzilla when I was a tester, I’d quit and become a gardener), co oczywiście nie poprawiło napiętych stosunków z Moverem, który dzielnie mi we wtorek jak tylko wyszedłem z roboty złożył nowe biurko, podczas gdy ja bezczelnie wczoraj stwierdziłem, że po spędzeniu upojnego przedpołudnia pod ambasadą jednak popracuję z domu, a biurko zacznę molestować dopiero dziś. No a dziś ten ogródek, niewdzięcznik ze mnie, wiem. (Biurko, rzecz jasna, zajebiste, rok na takie czekałem.)
