W ramach Tygodnia Francuskiego na <cite>[Idle Words](http://idlewords.com/ 'fighting francophobia since wednesday')</cite> – cała prawda o francuskich naleśnikach:

> Crêpes can sound intimidating if you have never made them, but I want to reassure every reader that a crêpe is the perfect bachelor food – easy to make, hard to ruin. More pliable than a steak or a pancake, a crêpe can also hold a wider variety of fillings, both sweet and savory. Most importantly, it is forgiving of mistakes in making the batter. Forget to add milk? No problem, you just made noodles! Leave out the eggs, and you have a dairy motzah; leave out the flour, and you’ve made custard. Each alternative is delicious, particularly when you add Béchamel sauce. And even if you forget two ingredients, you have an odds-on chance of making something edible, like scrambled eggs, or a nice glass of hot milk.
