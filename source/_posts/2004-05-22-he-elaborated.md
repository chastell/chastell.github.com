Once again I have to try your patience, and, instead of presenting you any original content, simply link to <cite>Idle Words</cite>, for the [newest of Maciej’s productions](http://www.idlewords.com/2004/05/attacked_by_thugs.htm '‘Attacked by Thugs’, a police story') seems to be the best ever, and aside from being (er, once again) about my country it’s definitely the most amusing piece I’ve read since I-don’t-know-when.

I could add that during the 24 years of my life in Warsaw I’ve been assaulted twice – for a total loss of 2 zł[^1] – but both situations were rather anticlimactic and are no match for Maciej’s story, while at the same time my contats with our police were definitely not that interesting either (and where is my bicycle, you lazy sluggards who didn’t even bother to get out of the station and check out my burgled basement, I wonder).
