This is <span class='chastell-net'>chastell.net</span>, a web home of one Piotr Szotkowski (a.k.a. – perhaps somewhat unsurprisingly – [chastell](chastell)), who can be reached at <chastell@chastell.net> and followed on either [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/chastell) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/chastell).

<span class='chastell-net'>chastell.net</span> is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org), a sweet publishing framework for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which, in turn, is a lovely static-site generator for hackers.
